:::info
This is a current work in progress representing **version 11**.

- The functionality is **stable and can be used in production**, but we may do small breaking API-changes between patches until we reach `11.0.0`
- The packages are published with the `next`-tag on npm

:::

### Installation / upgrading

import { InstallSnippet } from '@site/src/components/InstallSnippet';

<InstallSnippet pkgs="@trpc/server@next @trpc/client@next @trpc/react-query@next @trpc/next@next @tanstack/react-query@latest @tanstack/react-query-devtools@latest" />

## `@trpc/next` ssr mode now requires a prepass helper with `ssr: true`

This is to fix https://github.com/trpc/trpc/issues/5378 where `react-dom` was imported regardless if you were using this functionality or not.

See [SSR docs](../client/nextjs/ssr.md)

## Reverse-chronological changelog

> This is a draft document. It will be updated to a proper guide as we get closer to the v11 release.
> The only major thing that will incur work for you is that you will need to do is to update TanStack Query to v5.0.0.

### Added `inferProcedureBuilderResolverOptions<T>`-helper (non-breaking)

Adds a helper to infer the options for a procedure builder resolver. This is useful if you want to create reusable functions for different procedures.

See test [here](https://github.com/trpc/trpc/blob/743fa6aed8ac889d9c60f321c4b4ad060b56e791/packages/server/src/unstable-core-do-not-import/procedureBuilder.test.ts#L36-L231) for a reference on how to use it

### Transformers are moved to links (breaking)

> TypeScript will guide you through this migration
>
> Only applies if you use data transformers.

You now setup data transformers in the `links`-array instead of when you initialize the tRPC-client;

Wherever you have a HTTP Link you have to add `transformer: superjson` if you use transformers:

```ts
httpBatchLink({
  url: '/api/trpc',
  transformer: superjson, // <-- add this
});
```

```ts
createTRPCNext<AppRouter>({
  // [..]
  transformer: superjson, // <-- add this
});
```

### Added support for short-hand router definitions (non-breaking)

See [Merging routers](../server/merging-routers.md#defining-an-inline-sub-router-inline-sub-router)

```ts
const appRouter = router({
  // Shorthand plain object for creating a sub-router
  nested1: {
    proc: publicProcedure.query(() => '...'),
  },
  // Equivalent of:
  nested2: router({
    proc: publicProcedure.query(() => '...'),
  }),
});
```

### Deleted `inferHandlerInput<T>` and `ProcedureArgs<T>` (non-breaking for most)

> If these types mean nothing for you or your codebase, just ignore this

Use `inferProcedureInput<TProcedure>` instead & `TRPCProcedureOptions` instead

### Added `useSuspenseQueries()`

See [useSuspenseQueries](../client/react/suspense.md#usesuspensequeries)

https://github.com/trpc/trpc/pull/5226

### Refactor internal generics (breaking)

We have refactored our internal generics and made them more readable (TODO: link procedure builder sauce)

### React is now >=18.2.0 (breaking)

Check their migration guide: https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/08/react-18-upgrade-guide

### `wsLink` improvements (minor)

- Ability to pass a `Promise` in the `url`-callback if servers switch location during deploys
- Added new `lazy` option that makes the websocket automatically disconnect when there are no pending requests

### `rawInput` in middleware is now a `getRawInput` (breaking)

While we're not doing anything differently internally (just yet) this is help support a much requested feature in tRPC: content types other than JSON.

### Simplified types and `.d.ts` outputs

Procedures in your router now only emit their input & output - where before they would also contain the full context object for every procedure, leading to unnecessary complexity in e.g. `.d.ts`.

### React Query peerDep is now v5 (breaking)

Check their migration guide: https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/framework/react/guides/migrating-to-v5

### Exports names `AbcProxyXyz` has been renamed to `AbcXyz` (non-breaking)

The proxy names were due to v9 using the `AbcXyz` names, these have been removed and the proxy ones have been renamed to the non-proxy names, e.g:

- `createTRPCClient` was deprecated from v9, and is now completely removed. The `createTRPCProxyClient` has been renamed to `createTRPCClient` instead. `createTRPCProxyClient` is now marked as deprecated.

### SSG Helpers (non-breaking for most)

- `createSSGHelpers` were for v9 which has now been removed. the v10 equivalent `createProxySSGHelpers` have been renamed to `createSSGHelpers` now instead.
- `createProxySSGHelpers` is now deprecated but aliased to `createSSGHelpers` for backwards compatibility.
- Removed exported type `CreateSSGHelpersOptions`

## `.unstable_concat()` removed

To our knowledge, this was never used by anyone. If you need it, please open an issue on GitHub.

We might add it back in the future if there is a need for it.

### `interop`-mode has been removed

We have removed the `interop`-mode from tRPC. This was a mode that allowed you to have an easy transition period from v9 to v10. This mode was never meant to be supported long-term and we have now removed it.
