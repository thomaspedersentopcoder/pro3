# Changes in v11

- `.unstable_concat()` removed

## `interop`-mode has been removed

...

## SSG Helpers

- `createSSGHelpers` were for v9 which has now been removed. the v10 equivalent `createProxySSGHelpers` have been renamed to `createSSGHelpers` now instead.
- `createProxySSGHelpers` is now deprecated but aliased to `createSSGHelpers` for backwards compatibility.
- Removed exported type `CreateSSGHelpersOptions`

## Exports names `AbcProxyXyz` has been renamed to `AbcXyz`

The proxy names were due to v9 using the `AbcXyz` names, these have been removed and the proxy ones have been renamed to the non-proxy names, e.g:

- `createTRPCClient` was deprecated from v9, and is now completely removed. The `createTRPCProxyClient` has been renamed to `createTRPCClient` instead. `createTRPCProxyClient` is now marked as deprecated.

## React Query peerDep is now v5

Check their migration guide: https://tanstack.com/query/v5/docs/react/guides/migrating-to-v5

FIXME: Update our docs where applicable

- `defaultPageParam` -> `initialPageParam`
- [...]

## `rawInput` in middleware is now a `getRawInput`

While we're not doing anything differently internally (just yet) this is help support a much requested feature in tRPC: content types other than JSON.

## Simplified types and `.d.ts` outputs

Procedures in your router now only emit their input & output - where before they would also contain the full context object for every procedure, leading to unnecessary complexity in e.g. `.d.ts`.

## `wsLink` improvements

- Ability to pass a `Promise` in the `url`-callback if servers switch location during deploys

## Moved internal types to `@trpc/server/unstableInternalTypesExport`

We exported a bunch of utility functions that we used in tRPC within `@trpc/server`, these have now be moved to `@trpc/server/unstableInternalTypesExport`. Needless to say, you should not use those.

If you're making an adapter for tRPC, we're happy to move these to another export and ensure they don't break between minor versions.

Refactor: `inferAsyncReturnType<x>` -> `Awaited<ReturnType<x>>`
